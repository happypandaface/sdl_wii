-Add respawn points and make it all link in gameProps, (maybs have activated spawn points)
-Make it so you only respawn when everyone is dead
Make it so on respawn it reloads the level (changing the spawn)
	This will make it so there will be MEMORY LEAKS so this will be hard
Add a small obsticle course with spike balls and moving spike balls.
OPTIONAL: make spike balls only kill when they spike out
Make spike balls knock you back when they hit you.
-Make it so you blow into chunks when you die
Add a suicide button "A"
Make it so allies can eat those chunks and regain health "dude, just make me some meat" "nah dude that kills me"
-Make it so you can have multiple images with multiple offsets in an animation frame (animation.cpp)
